# Rural Fitness
## ⚠️ARCHIVED PROJECT

**This is an archived project from my bootcamp with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) in 2023, kept for historical reference. It does not represent my current skill level or tech stack.**

Rural Fitness is a fictional, state-of-the-art gym and spa. Located in the countryside, as the name suggests, it aims to provide high-quality facilities to those who live / holiday in more rural areas, while also providing a luxurious spa experience for those looking to relax.
